## Quick Start

1. **Clone** into your Moodle tree:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/moodle/local
   git clone https://github.com/laurentdavid/moodle-local_routing.git router
   ```
2. **Install** in Moodle via **Site administration ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Notifications**.
3. *(Optional)* Enable ‚Äúclean‚Äù URLs with Apache:

Either copy the .htaccess file from the plugin root to your Moodle root or create
a new `.htaccess` file in your Moodle root with the following content:

   ```bash
   ```apacheconf
   # in your Moodle root or local/router/.htaccess
   FallbackResource /r.php
   ```

   And ensure `AllowOverride All` in your original `<Directory>` block.
